# MovieSlate
MovieSlate is a movie tracking tool for stat loving cinemaphiles. This app allows users to browser and search for movies, both released and coming soon, that can be added to their watch list. Once a user watches a movie they can mark their movies as watched which will automatically add it to their watch stats. The movie watch stats will be the primary focus of the app as this will allow users to view a breakdown of their annual movie statistics such as percentage of each genre watched, total hours watched, etc. Users will be able to view and share their stats with their friends by connecting through the app. Through the friends feature users will be able to share reccommended movies as well.
